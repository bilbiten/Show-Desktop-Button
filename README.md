This is my first Gnome Shell Extension.

The idea of this was taken from the MGSE Window List as a proof of concept, and for the fun of learning how js works with Gnome Shell, it has been a great learning curve already.

### TODO:
reimpliment placement options
reimpliment localisation
impliment icon and spacing options

### Description: 

Places a button to the left of the Window List to hide all windows, and the overview when active, and show the current desktop(credit: MGSE, erguille, madkristoff, mbokil). 

newest v13: reimplimented entire structure based on shell changes since 3.12, this is now more of an actual button than ever(see wip branch too).
tray gone as it has been practically removed from 3.16, initial 3.12-3.16 support.
patched non-working show desktop function
temporarily disabled placement options

v12: Message Tray option returns, can add to the center of the tray.
*New icon(thanks madkristoff!)* 
Position setting in prefs tool. 
todo: icon setting, add hide overview switch, compat w/show desktop from overview extension.
