This is my first Gnome Shell Extension.

The idea of this was taken from the MGSE Window List as a proof of concept, and for the fun of learning how js works with Gnome Shell, it has been a great learning curve already.

### TODO:
fix for 3.10 onwards
remove tray
reimpliment localisation
possibly add option to desktop popup menu!!!

### Description: 

Places a button to the left of the Window List to hide all windows, and the overview when active, and show the current desktop(credit: MGSE, erguille, madkristoff, mbokil). 

v10: Message Tray option returns, can add to the center of the tray.
*New icon(thanks madkristoff!)* 
Position setting in prefs tool. 
todo: icon setting, add hide overview switch, compat w/show desktop from overview extension.
